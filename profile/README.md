## üëã Welcome visitor

We are building a game editor and engine for the web, based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).
The editor is collaborative and real time: several users can edit the same project simultaneously, including 3D models, voxel maps, and scenes.

The project takes inspiration from earlier tools such as [Superpowers](https://github.com/superpowers) and [Craftstudio](https://sparklinlabs.itch.io/craftstudio).
