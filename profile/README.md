## 👋 Welcome

JollyPixel is a playful, real time, collaborative editor for building JavaScript games with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It is **open source**, **free to use**, and designed to be accessible and easy to learn.

**What you get**

1. **Create together, live**. Edit scenes, assets, and logic in real time with your family, friends, or team.
2. **Beginner friendly, pro ready**. Accessible for young and new creators, yet powerful for professionals. Prototype simple games, scale to larger projects, and extend JollyPixel with open source addons and new editors.
3. **Built for games**. Many tools or frameworks focus on visual experiences to build cool websites, which is different. JollyPixel is designed for gameplay, scenes, assets, and scripting from **day one**.
4. **Works in the browser**. No installs. Open a link, start building.

We take inspiration from earlier tools such as [Superpowers](https://github.com/superpowers) and [CraftStudio](https://sparklinlabs.itch.io/craftstudio).

### ❤️ Contributors

Building an editor is **hard**, and we welcome contributors of all levels and expertise. We need developers, artists but also people to help with growth and branding.
