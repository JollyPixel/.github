## üëã Welcome

JollyPixel is a playful, real time, collaborative editor for building JavaScript games with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It is **open source**, **free to use**, and do everything to be accessible and easy to learn.

**What you get**

1. **Create together, live**. Edit scenes, assets, and logic in real time with your team.
2. **Works in the browser**. No installs. Open a link, start building.
3. **No PhD required**. Intuitive editors and APIs help you grow step by step, without losing motivation.
4. **Game production, not website tooling**. Many tools or frameworks focus on visual experiences to build cool websites, which is different. JollyPixel is designed for gameplay, scenes, assets, and scripting from **day one**.

We take inspiration from earlier tools such as [Superpowers](https://github.com/superpowers) and [CraftStudio](https://sparklinlabs.itch.io/craftstudio).

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributors
